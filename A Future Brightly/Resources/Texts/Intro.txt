This game will unfold much like a story, and then at certain points you'll be given a choice of how to progress the story.
There are different paths to take, but hopefully they'll all end happily :)
Let me know what you think about it after you've finished.
I love you so so much Emily, and I hope your birthday is wonderful :***
