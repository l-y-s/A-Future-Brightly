The officiant starts speaking, and there's an odd release of tension.
All the stress that built up over the last few months just melts away.

It was a hassle getting all the arrangements in place.
We settled on a small-ish guest list, family and a few close friends.
The venue was booked after much back and forth between you and him.
Decorations all over the place. Cake tasting was definitely fun though.
As was picking food, which you're eagerly awaiting at the reception.
And picking out the dress was a whole other mess.

"And do you promise to love and support each other for the rest of your life?"
The words from the officiant snap you back to the present.
"I do," you say smiling, as the sudden rush of emotion causes your eyes to well up.
You look at him, and he's looking back at you with the most intensity you've ever seen.
"Of course I do," he says, also smiling. And you know he will.

You kiss before the officiant even finishes. You couldn't help yourselves.
There are cheers and applause. Some are teary-eyed as well.
Soon the reception starts, and it's probably the best party you've ever thrown.
Dinner is served, all manner of drink is flowing. The band begins playing behind the joviality.
You cut the cake, you dance, and you're incredibly happy.

After many hours of speeches, dancing, drinking, and pictures, the reception winds down.
You nudge him. He hasn't left your side all night.
He smiles at you, understanding.
You make a quick but ceremonious exit, all of your guests cheer and celebrate more.
You make your way to the waiting car outside, and drive off toward the hotel you're staying at.
The honeymoon, and the rest of your life, await.
