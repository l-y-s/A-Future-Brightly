You watch from your chair on the balcony, temporarily setting your book down.
You look over at him, intently reading his book. You can tell he's at a good part.
You look at him more closely.
He has many more wrinkles now. You can see his eyes have somehow gotten deeper.
But he's still who he's always been. And you love him for that.

You look back on your life.
There were many ups and downs over the decades.
Situations change, friends come and go, but you've always been together.
You don't have many new experiences anymore; you've done most everything you've wanted to.
But even the routine still satisfies you.
You wonder how it turned out so well.

He's still embroiled in his book. He hasn't even noticed you looking at him so long.
But you reach over and take his hand in yours anyways.
He looks up from his book and smiles at you.
You wonder what he's thinking.
He kisses your hand, and in that familiar gesture you know how much he loves you.
You scoot over to him, wrapping around his arm and laying your head on his shoulder.
You watch the sun set together.
