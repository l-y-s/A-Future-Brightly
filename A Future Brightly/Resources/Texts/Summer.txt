Not to say it wasn't busy, because it absolutely was.
Colleges sent out acceptance letters, and you'll be off to SDSU next year.
AP testing was exhausting, but of course you ended up doing well in the end.
Finals were exhausting, but again, you did fine.
The senior trip was unbearably annoying though;
Waiting in a bus all day for nothing before leaving again sucked.
Graduation was a blur, it didn't feel real at the time.
But Sober Grad Night was a ton of fun, who knew Scandia was so cool.

Shortly after school lets out for the last time, you and your friends go on a trip.
The lot of you gather up and drive all the way to Disneyland.
Despite the long hours, the hot sun, the lines, and the drive, its a fantastic time.

Throughout the summer, you continue working and preparing for college.
And you find yourself seeing him more and more.
He stops by late at night, giving some excuse but you know he's just trying to see you.
He's persistent, thats for sure.
Sometimes its annoying, sometimes it makes you feel guilty.
But sometimes its also really sweet.

You guess you could call it dating.
You like him a lot. And you can tell he really likes you.
You text all the time. Mostly about nothing, but sometimes about a lot.
You feel yourself getting close to him, even though you probably shouldn't...

Come mid August, you're ready to leave for school.
Affair are in order, all that's left to do is drive down in a couple days.
You're excited and scared all at the same time.
But he's talking with you throughout the whole thing.
You're glad he's around during this time.
But should it really keep going, now that we're parting ways?

You have a long discussion with him over many days.
He makes you happy, and its hard to ignore that.
But can you make it work?
