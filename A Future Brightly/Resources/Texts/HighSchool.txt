You walk in and find your usual table over by the bookshelves, still empty for the next few moments.
Classes let out, people being to file in behind you.
You take your seat and start pulling out your homework despite the fact you probably won't finish.
One by one, friends come in and set up around the table.
You attempt to keep concentrating on your work, but all the banter around you makes it difficult.
