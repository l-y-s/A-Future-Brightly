You slip your bag off and hang it up on a nearby hook.
It's always quiet when you get home, seeing as its the middle of the day.
At first its welcoming; dealing with those kids can be draining.
But after so long the house just seems empty.
You fix yourself a snack before heading into the living room.
You turn the TV on, more for background noise than anything. But How I Met Your Mother never gets old.
You settle onto the couch and start to grade a stack of today's test.

The jingle of keys in a lock rouses you.
Your papers have collapsed and splayed out to your side. You must have fallen asleep.
You peek your head over the couch as the front door opens and he walks in.
He sorts through the mail in his hand while walking into the living room.
He absentmindedly sets his laptop bag on the table, and before he even looks up you've closed the distance.
You open your mouth to speak but have to stifle a yawn as you wrap your arms around his neck.
"Hi sleepy girl," he says smiling. You kiss him, which is the best greeting he could ask for.
