You realize you've been crushing his hand during that entire last stretch and release.
He bends over and kisses you on the forehead before backing off as the nurse hands you your new daughter.
She's stopped crying and looks almost asleep now, having been tightly swaddled.
You can't stop smiling.

"Mama, where is she?"
You reluctantly open your eyes, fighting the urge to just roll over and go back to sleep.
Your son is insistently pushing your shoulder, frowning slightly.
You look up over him and see your mother in the doorway.
"Sorry sweet pea, he was just so excited", she says.
"It's alright mom", you say groggily.
You look over your opposite shoulder. Your husband is passed out in the chair, of course.
"Mooooooom..."
Your son is becoming more impatient. You call a nurse and she wheels your daughter in from the nursery.
"She's so small!" he says a bit too loudly; your daughter starts crying.
You take her in your arms and almost immediately stops crying. You hope this continues indefinitely.
By this time your husband has awoken and joined in with fussing over the baby.
Everything feels right.
